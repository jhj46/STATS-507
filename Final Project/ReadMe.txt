Hello.
Thank you for looking at my GitHub Repo folder on my Final Project.
I would like to note that my Python Jupyter Source File is all that you need to replicate my work. 
I was not able to upload all of the model files here due to GitHub preventing me. 

The Brainstorm file is all you need as it documents the code ran, comments on my project structure, and Huggingface resources I utilized.

I also have a summary document typed in IEEE formatting here in PDF format which you can read for a quick summary of the project and results of finetuning models.
