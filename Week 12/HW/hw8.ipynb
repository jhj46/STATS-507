    "## Submission Instructions\n",
    "Your homework solutions should be written entirely in this Jupyter notebook file. Once it contains your solutions, you should submit this notebook through Canvas. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before submitting, please make sure to __Cells->Run All__ executes without errors; errors in your code translate directly to point deductions. \n",
    "In general, you don't need to do explicitly raise errors (e.g. with the ```raise``` function) if we don't ask you to in the problem statement.\n",
    "However, even in cases where we ask you to check for errors, your submission should not contain any examples of your functions actually raising those errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that many parts of this homework where you are expected to type in code will have ```NotImplementedError()``` as a placeholder. You need to delete this function and replace it with your own code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Homework tips \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start early!** If you run into trouble installing things or importing packages, itâ€™s\n",
    "best to find those problems well in advance, not the night before your assignment is\n",
    "due when we cannot help you!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Make sure you back up your work!** At a minimum, do your work in a Dropbox\n",
    "folder. Better yet, use git, which is well worth your time and effort to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Be careful to follow directions!** Remember that Python is case sensitive. If\n",
    "you are ask you to define a function called my_function and you define a function\n",
    "called My_Function, you will not receive full credit. You may want to copy-paste\n",
    "the function names below to make sure that the functions in your notebook match.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Error checking\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to do error checking (raising errors, etc.) in your code unless we explicitly ask you to so in a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nbgrader\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using `nbgrader` to grade your jupyter notebook. You will notice some `read-only` cells in the assignment that contain `assert` statements. These are tests that your code must pass for your solution to be correct. If any of the tests fail, you will get an python error and not get points for that question. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The tests shown not are not comprehensive; additional tests will be used at grading time. You are encouraged to read the problem carefully and verify your code covers all possible cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Be careful:** If a jupyter notebook cell takes longer than `60s` to run, the autograder will not grade it and you will receive zero credit for that question."
