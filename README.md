# STATS 507
 Repository for my Stats Python Course. This serves as a backup of my work in case of local device failure and also to display my portfolio of work to others.
 
STATS 507 surveys the software tools that are currently popular among data scientists in academia and
industry. The course begins with an accelerated introduction to programming in Python. Next, we focus
on Pythonâ€™s scientific computing stack: numpy, scipy, pandas, and scikit-learn. We also cover regular
expressions, relational databases, and the UNIX/Linux command line. The final part of the course is an
introduction to deep learning using PyTorch.
